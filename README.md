## Spring Boot + Okta + PKCE

This app demonstrates integrating an Okta OpenID Connect application with Spring Boot.

You can deploy directly to Heroku and provision an Okta org at the same time!

The app is already configured to integrate with your new Okta org.

When you click the purple button above, you'll give the app a unique name to run in Heroku.
